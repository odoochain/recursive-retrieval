In discharging this responsibility, senior management must-\n\n\t(a) establish a written compliance policy and ensure that it is kept up to date;\n\n\t(b) communicate the policy to all officers and ensure that appropriate remedial or disciplinary actions are taken if the compliance policy is breached;\n\n\t(c) establish a compliance function commensurate with the size, nature of operations and complexity of the financial institution, having regard to the requirements in paragraphs 7 and 8;\n\n\t(d) provide sufficient resources for the compliance function, including officers with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\n\t(e) ensure that the compliance function is able to secure assistance from other functions with specific expertise (for example, legal, Shariah review or risk management) and has clear authority to engage with any officers and obtain access to relevant information for purposes of discharging its responsibilities;\n\n\t(f) ensure that the compliance function is able to engage relevant external expertise to undertake compliance assessments in specific areas4 where necessary;\n\n\t(g) ensure that the compliance function is kept informed of any organisational developments to facilitate the timely identification of compliance risk;\n\n\t(h) report to the board regularly on compliance issues and promptly on any material incidents of non-compliance (for example, failures that may attract a significant risk of legal or regulatory sanction);\n\n\t(i) report to the board at least annually on the effectiveness of the financial institution's overall management of compliance risk in such a manner as to assist the board in carrying out its responsibilities as set out in paragraph 6.2(d); and\n\n\t(j) inform the board of the CCO's cessation from office and the reasons leading to the cessation.\n\n- S 6.5 In relation to paragraph 6.4(a), senior management must set out principles to be followed by all officers and explain the main processes by which compliance risk is identified and managed. In particular, senior management must make clear in the compliance policy that the primary responsibility to manage compliance risk lies with the business lines and that the establishment of the compliance function does not substitute the primary role of business lines in managing compliance risk. This includes the responsibility of business lines to own, develop and update systems, policies, processes and procedures to manage compliance risk inherent in business activities.\n\n- S 6.6 For the purpose of paragraph 6.4(h), senior management must include the following information in its reports:\n\n\t\t(a) an identification and assessment of the compliance issues faced by the financial institution. These issues include any significant shortfalls arising from the implementation or execution of internal controls put in place to manage compliance risk;\n\n\t\t(b) compliance issues involving any member of senior management of the financial institution, and the status of any associated investigations or other actions being taken; and\n\n\t\t(c) plans to manage compliance issues, as well as the need for any additional policies or procedures to deal with any new compliance risk.\n\n- S 6.7 In relation to paragraph 6.4(i), senior management must take into account the outcome of the compliance function's assessment of compliance risk as described in paragraph 8.8. The reports must, at minimum, include an assessment of the key compliance risks faced by the financial institution and their implications on the financial institution's capacity to manage compliance risk going forward.\n\n\t- 7 Organisation of the compliance function\n\n- S 7.1 A financial institution must organise its compliance function in a manner that allows compliance risk to be managed effectively, taking into account the size, nature of operations and complexity of the financial institution's business and the legal and regulatory environment in the jurisdictions or sectors in which it has operations.\n\n- S 7.2 Where compliance function responsibilities are shared between a dedicated compliance unit and other control functions-\n\n\t\t(a) the allocation of the compliance function responsibilities, including that for timely communication and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the board, must be clearly defined and documented in the compliance policy;\n\n\t\t(b) the CCO must have overall responsibility for coordinating the identification and management of compliance risk at the institution-wide level, and ensuring that compliance monitoring and testing are carried out consistently across the institution;\n\n\t\t(c) for the purpose of paragraph 7.2(b), the CCO must have a sound understanding of compliance risks which are under the purview of other control functions, including an understanding of controls applied to manage these risks;\n\n\t\t(d) arrangements for coordination among the control functions with the CCO and the compliance unit must be in place to ensure that the CCO is able to perform his responsibilities effectively. Arrangements should promote a view and approach to the management of compliance risk that is consistent across the organisation, including through adequate information flows and avenues to seek advice on compliance issues; and\n\n\t\t(e) senior management must ensure that officers in other control functions have the capacity and expertise to deliver their broader mandates while providing adequate focus to their compliance function responsibilities.\n\n- S 7.3 Where the CCO also assumes responsibilities for other control functions, the CCO must ensure that his independence and ability to provide sufficient time, focus and commitment to his responsibilities in respect of the compliance function is not impaired.\n\n- S 7.4 In relation to paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3-\n\n\t\t(a) the board must approve the sharing of compliance function responsibilities between a dedicated compliance unit and other control functions; and\n\n\t\t(b) compliance function responsibilities cannot be shared with, nor can the CCO assume responsibilities for, internal audit as such practices would render the independent review process described in paragraph 9.1 ineffective.\n\n- S 7.5 A large financial institution is required to establish a unit or department, headed by the CCO, which is dedicated to carrying out the compliance function responsibilities set out in paragraph 8. This is to provide necessary focus on the management of compliance risk in view of the inherent complexity and scale of operations of large financial institutions.\n\n- S 7.6 Notwithstanding paragraph 7.3, the CCO of a large financial institution is not allowed to assume the responsibilities of other control functions.\n\n\t- Independence\n\n- S 7.7 The compliance function must be independent of business lines in order to carry out its role as a control function effectively. As such, a financial institution must ensure that the compliance function is not placed in a position where there are real or potential conflicts in respect of its scope of responsibilities, reporting lines or remuneration.\n\n- S 7.8 A financial institution must ensure that the remuneration of the CCO and officers performing compliance functions are structured in a way that does not compromise their independence (for example, the remuneration must not be related to the financial performance of any particular business line) and must be primarily based on the achievement of their compliance function responsibilities.\n\n- G 7.9 A constructive and cooperative working relationship between the compliance function and business lines can improve the overall identification and management of compliance risk. In practice, this can involve the direct participation of the compliance function in providing legal and regulatory input to business processes or decisions5.\n\n- S 7.10 Where such arrangements referred to in paragraph 7.9 exist, a financial institution must ensure that-\n\n\t\t(a) the compliance function is not placed in a position of conflict;\n\n\t\t(b) the accountability of the compliance function is properly documented6 and\n\n\t\t(c) the compliance function is not prevented from highlighting compliance issues relating to any business decisions to the board or senior management, where necessary.\n\n\t- Resources\n\n- S 7.11 Officers undertaking compliance function responsibilities must have the necessary qualifications and experience. In particular, they must have a sound understanding of relevant legal and regulatory requirements and the implications of such requirements on a financial institution's operations. This includes possessing relevant local knowledge and expertise in respect of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in the jurisdictions in which the financial institution conducts its activities.\n\n- S 7.12 A financial institution must ensure that the compliance function is kept abreast of developments in legal and regulatory requirements by undertaking regular and systematic programmes and training.\n\n- G 7.13 As one of the means to develop a strong compliance function, a financial institution should consider mandating or encouraging compliance function officers to possess accredited qualifications in the area of compliance.\n\n\t- 8 Responsibilities of the compliance function\n\n- S 8.1 A financial institution must ensure that the scope of responsibilities of the compliance function sufficiently cover all businesses, branches and subsidiaries, whether in or outside Malaysia and whether or not an activity is carried out by the financial institution itself or by a third party on its behalf. This means that a financial institution which conducts business internationally through local subsidiaries or branches, or in other jurisdictions where it does not have a physical presence, must also ensure compliance with all local legal and regulatory requirements applicable in those jurisdictions.\n\n- S 8.2 Where a financial institution has operations in more than one jurisdiction, it must consider the need to establish a local compliance unit or department to discharge independent compliance function responsibilities in respect of its operations in each of these jurisdictions. Where a local compliance unit or department is established, there must be appropriate mechanisms for coordination between the local compliance unit or department and the compliance function of the financial institution, to ensure that compliance risk is managed effectively.",

In particular, they must have a sound understanding of relevant legal and regulatory requirements and the implications of such requirements on a financial institution's operations. This includes possessing relevant local knowledge and expertise in respect of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in the jurisdictions in which the financial institution conducts its activities.\n\n- S 7.12 A financial institution must ensure that the compliance function is kept abreast of developments in legal and regulatory requirements by undertaking regular and systematic programmes and training.\n\n- G 7.13 As one of the means to develop a strong compliance function, a financial institution should consider mandating or encouraging compliance function officers to possess accredited qualifications in the area of compliance.\n\n\t- 8 Responsibilities of the compliance function\n\n- S 8.1 A financial institution must ensure that the scope of responsibilities of the compliance function sufficiently cover all businesses, branches and subsidiaries, whether in or outside Malaysia and whether or not an activity is carried out by the financial institution itself or by a third party on its behalf. This means that a financial institution which conducts business internationally through local subsidiaries or branches, or in other jurisdictions where it does not have a physical presence, must also ensure compliance with all local legal and regulatory requirements applicable in those jurisdictions.\n\n- S 8.2 Where a financial institution has operations in more than one jurisdiction, it must consider the need to establish a local compliance unit or department to discharge independent compliance function responsibilities in respect of its operations in each of these jurisdictions. Where a local compliance unit or department is established, there must be appropriate mechanisms for coordination between the local compliance unit or department and the compliance function of the financial institution, to ensure that compliance risk is managed effectively.",
